Founded in 1999, Hanyang Petrochemical Co., Ltd. is a petrochemical distribution company and an official distributor of Hanwha Solutions’ PO Division (Chemicals), supplying key polyethylene products including LDPE, LLDPE (mLLDPE), and EVA to the domestic Korean market.

With over two decades of experience in domestic distribution, we handle not only Hanwha Solutions products but also supply HDPE, PP, and other third-party or imported materials according to customer requirements.

We focus on recommending suitable materials based on application, availability, and market conditions, which is our key strength.

Since our establishment, we have built and maintained business relationships with a wide range of customers, from large corporations to small and medium-sized manufacturers, supporting both small-volume purchases and regular supply arrangements.

Our objective is not simply to distribute products, but to serve as a reliable and long-term business partner for our customers.

Please feel free to contact us anytime regarding product inquiries, pricing, and availability.
